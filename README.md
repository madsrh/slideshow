- The slideshow cycles through all images in the folder
- Files named after the naming scheme will be deleted when the date is past

- The page will automatic check for new files every 24 hours

NAMING SCHEME:
Files are named with a prefix and a date. When the date is past, the file is deleted.
The date format is: 2022 12 30
